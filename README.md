## Importance of Portfolio
A portfolio is a living and changing
collection of records that reflect your
accomplishments, skills, experiences,
and attributes. It highlights and
showcases samples of some of your best
work, along with life experiences, values
and achievements. The personal
information that you incorporate into
your portfolio can greatly reflect on your
abilities as an individual as well as
become a useful tool in marketing
yourself to employers, corporations,
colleges and universities. A portfolio
does not take the place of a resume, but
it can accentuate your abilities and what
you can offer in the chosen field.
